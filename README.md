# Insightify ‚Äì Causal Inference for Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

## üìå Description
Insightify is an analytics application that leverages **causal inference** to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.  
The system measures the **true impact of campaigns** on customer spending behavior using demographic, transaction, and product category data.  

With Insightify, businesses can:
- Identify the best customer segments for campaigns.  
- Determine the optimal timing for campaigns.  
- Design strategies to improve **Return on Investment (ROI)**.

## üéØ Project Objectives
1. Estimate the causal impact of campaigns (Average Treatment Effect / ATE).  
2. Explore heterogeneity of effects (CATE/ITE) across segments or individuals.  
3. Predict whether a campaign is **on target** or **off target** for a customer.  
4. Build an interactive application (Streamlit/HuggingFace) for prediction simulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Variable Identification**
   - Treatment: campaign participation.  
   - Outcome: customer spending.  
   - Confounders: demographics, historical transactions, product categories.  

2. **Effect Estimation (Backdoor Adjustment)**
   - OLS Regression Adjustment.  
   - Propensity Score Matching (PSM).  
   - Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW).  
   - Doubly Robust (DR Learner).  

3. **Heterogeneous & Individual Effects**
   - Causal Forest (CATE/ITE).  
   - Customer segmentation based on causal effects.  

4. **Business Insights**
   - Segments most influenced by the campaign.  
   - Optimal campaign timing.  
   - ROI estimation.  

5. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit/HuggingFace App:
     - Input: user attributes (age, income, historical spending, product categories).  
     - Output: prediction of whether the campaign is **on target** along with the estimated uplift.
